# Employer-Employee System (EES) Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
The Employer-Employee System (EES) is a web-based application built using Django to facilitate core interactions between employers and employees, focusing on employee self-service and leave management. The system aims to be end-to-end inclusive, prioritizing usability and cultural sensitivity for diverse users while maintaining scalability to manage a streamlined user base efficiently. Accessibility features are included as optional enhancements to accommodate users with disabilities.

### 1.1 Objectives
- Provide an intuitive platform for employees to manage personal information and submit leave requests.
- Enable Employers to approve/reject leave requests with role-based access control (RBAC).
- Support multilingual capabilities and cultural inclusivity.
- Streamline user management to avoid issues with excessive user types.
- Optionally implement accessibility features (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance) to support users with disabilities.

### 1.2 Scope
- **Core Features**: User authentication, employee profile management, leave request submission, and leave approval workflow.
- **User Roles**: Employee (self-service access) and Employer (leave approval and system oversight).
- **Inclusivity**: Multilingual support; optional accessibility features for users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced features like task management, communication tools, or accessibility features unless explicitly enabled in future phases.

## 2. Stakeholders
- **Employees**: Access self-service features (view profile, submit leave requests).
- **Employers**: Manage leave approvals and employee records.
- **IT Administrators**: Oversee system deployment, maintenance, and user provisioning.
- **End Users with Diverse Needs**: Users who may benefit from optional accessibility features (e.g., screen readers, high-contrast modes).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Management
- **UR1**: The system must support two user roles: Employee and Employer.
- **UR2**: Users must authenticate via username and password using Django’s built-in authentication system.
- **UR3**: RBAC must restrict Employer functions (e.g., leave approval) to authorized users only.
- **UR4**: Employee profiles must include basic fields (username, department) linked to the user account.

### 3.2 Employee Self-Service
- **ESS1**: Employees must view their profile (username, department) on a dashboard.
- **ESS2**: Employees must submit leave requests with fields for start date, end date, and reason.
- **ESS3**: Employees must view a list of their leave requests with status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).

### 3.3 Leave Management
- **LM1**: Employers must view all leave requests with details (employee, dates, reason, status).
- **LM2**: Employers must approve or reject pending leave requests.
- **LM3**: Leave requests must be stored with a timestamp and status history.

### 3.4 Multilingual Support
- **ML1**: The system must support Django’s i18n framework for future multilingual translations.
- **ML2**: The UI must accommodate right-to-left (RTL) languages (e.g., Arabic) in templates.

### 3.5 Optional Accessibility Features
- **A1 (Optional)**: The UI may comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) if enabled.
- **A2 (Optional)**: The system may support a high-contrast mode for visually impaired users if enabled.
- **A3 (Optional)**: Forms may include semantic HTML and accessible input fields (e.g., date pickers, labeled textareas) if enabled.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- **P1**: The system must handle up to 100 concurrent users without significant latency (response time < 2 seconds).
- **P2**: Database queries must be optimized to support efficient user and leave request retrieval.

### 4.2 Scalability
- **S1**: The system must use a modular design to allow future addition of features (e.g., task management, communication tools).
- **S2**: The database must support easy migration to PostgreSQL for larger user bases.

### 4.3 Security
- **SEC1**: User data must be encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).
- **SEC2**: The system must enforce strong password policies via Django’s auth validators.
- **SEC3**: CSRF protection must be enabled for all forms.

### 4.4 Usability
- **U1**: The UI must be responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **U2**: Navigation must be intuitive with clear labels and minimal clicks (e.g., max 2 clicks to submit a leave request).
- **U3**: The system must provide tooltips or help text for complex inputs.

### 4.5 Compliance
- **C1 (Optional)**: The system may comply with accessibility regulations (e.g., ADA, Section 508) if accessibility features are enabled.
- **C2**: The system must support data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR for user data handling).

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.2, Python 3.8+
- **Database**: SQLite (initial), with support for PostgreSQL in production
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Django templates with basic JavaScript for interactivity
- **Dependencies**: python-decouple for environment variables
- **Hosting**: Compatible with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for deployment

### 5.2 System Architecture
- **Monolithic Design**: Single Django application (`employee`) for simplicity.
- **Models**:
  - `Employee`: Links to Django `User` model, includes `is_employer` flag and department.
  - `LeaveRequest`: Stores leave details (employee, dates, reason, status).
- **Views**: Handle home dashboard, leave request submission, and approval workflows.
- **Templates**: Use standard HTML with optional ARIA attributes for accessibility if enabled.

### 5.3 Integration
- **I1**: Integrate with Django admin for user and data management.
- **I2**: Support future API endpoints for third-party integrations (e.g., communication tools).

## 6. Constraints
- **C1**: Limited to two user roles (Employee, Employer) to address the issue of "too many users" from the previous implementation.
- **C2**: Initial deployment uses SQLite to minimize setup complexity.
- **C3**: No external file uploads (e.g., documents) in the initial phase to reduce complexity.

## 7. Assumptions
- Users have basic internet access and modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Employers are trained to use the Django admin interface for user management.
- Accessibility testing will be conducted only if optional accessibility features are enabled, using tools like WAVE or Axe.

## 8. Deliverables
- **Source Code**: Django project with employee app, models, views, and templates.
- **Documentation**: Setup instructions, user guide for employees and Employers.
- **Deployment Plan**: Steps for local and cloud deployment.
- **Testing Plan**: Usability testing checklist; optional accessibility testing checklist if accessibility features are enabled.

## 9. Milestones
1. **Setup and Configuration** (1 week):
   - Initialize Django project, configure models, and set up authentication.
2. **Core Feature Development** (2 weeks):
   - Implement employee dashboard, leave request, and approval workflows.
3. **Optional Accessibility Implementation** (1 week, if enabled):
   - Add ARIA labels, high-contrast mode, and semantic HTML.
4. **Testing and Refinement** (1 week):
   - Conduct usability testing; include accessibility testing if features are enabled.
5. **Deployment** (1 week):
   - Deploy locally or on a cloud platform; provide user training.

## 10. Success Criteria
- Employees can log in, view their profile, and submit leave requests in under 2 minutes.
- Employers can approve/reject leave requests with minimal training.
- If enabled, the system passes WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility checks.
- The system supports 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- User feedback indicates high usability (e.g., 80% satisfaction in usability testing).

## 11. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Overloaded system due to excessive users.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce RBAC and limit user roles; optimize database queries.
- **Risk**: Accessibility non-compliance if optional features are enabled.
  - **Mitigation**: Use WCAG-compliant templates and test with screen readers if implemented.
- **Risk**: Language barriers for non-English users.
  - **Mitigation**: Enable Django i18n and prioritize key translations.

## 12. Future Enhancements
- Add features like task assignment, team communication, or scheduling tools.
- Implement analytics for employer insights (e.g., leave trends).
- Integrate with external tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) via APIs.
- Optionally enhance accessibility with voice input and advanced screen reader support.
