## Additional Notes
- **How to Use**: Copy each issue into GitHub’s issue creation interface or use a CSV import to bulk-create issues in the repository. Assign issues to the respective milestones in the GitHub Projects board.
- **Labels Setup**: Create labels (`setup`, `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `security`, `authentication`, `database`, `employee`, `employer`, `admin`, `i18n`, `accessibility`, `testing`, `usability`, `performance`, `documentation`, `deployment`) in the GitHub repository for organization.
- **Projects Board Columns**: Suggested columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done". Assign issues to columns based on progress.
- **Priority**: Prioritize Milestone 1 and 2 issues for core functionality; Milestone 3 (accessibility) is optional and can be deferred based on project needs.
